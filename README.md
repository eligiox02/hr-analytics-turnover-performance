# HR Analytics – Employee Turnover, Performance & Compensation Analysis  
*(Excel & Tableau)*

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **employee turnover, performance, satisfaction, and compensation** to identify the key drivers behind employee attrition and performance gaps across departments.

The analysis was conducted using **Excel for data preparation and KPI calculations**, and **Tableau for interactive dashboards and visual insights**.  
The project follows a structured **Statement of Work (SOW)**, simulating a real-world HR analytics engagement for leadership decision-making.

---

## Business Context
High employee turnover can significantly impact organizational performance, costs, and team stability.  
This project was designed to help HR leadership and department managers understand:

- Where employee turnover is concentrated  
- When employees are most likely to leave  
- Which employee profiles are at higher risk  
- Why employees choose to exit the organization  

The goal is to provide **clear, data-driven insights** to support retention strategies and address structural inefficiencies.

---

## Stakeholders
- HR Leadership  
- Department Managers  
- Executive Team  

---

## Scope & Objectives
Based on the approved SOW, this project focuses on:

- Identifying departments with above-average turnover  
- Analyzing employee tenure patterns and early-stage attrition  
- Evaluating relationships between:
  - Satisfaction
  - Performance
  - Compensation
  - Turnover
- Detecting internal salary inequality and market competitiveness gaps  

**Out of Scope**
- Predictive or real-time analytics  
- External third-party employee datasets  
- Legal or compliance evaluations  

---

## Data & Tools

### Data Sources
- Employee master data (tenure, department, position)
- Performance review scores (1–10 scale)
- Employee satisfaction survey results
- Salary and market benchmark comparisons
- Termination records and exit reasons

> All data used in this project is **simulated or anonymized** for analytical purposes.

---

### Tools & Technologies
- **Excel**
  - Pivot Tables
  - Advanced formulas
  - Data cleaning and validation
- **Tableau**
  - Interactive dashboards
  - KPI visualizations
  - Department-level analysis
- **Analytical Techniques**
  - KPI tracking
  - Trend analysis
  - Segmentation by tenure and department
  - Comparative analysis (internal vs market compensation)

---

## Key Metrics & Definitions
- **Turnover Rate:**  
  Terminations ÷ Average headcount per period
- **Low Satisfaction:**  
  Satisfaction score < 7
- **Below Market Salary:**  
  Salary gap < 0%
- **Early-Stage Attrition:**  
  Employee exits within the first year of tenure

---

## Analysis & Key Insights

### 1. Turnover Concentration by Department
Several departments (Strategy, Marketing, Sales) consistently exceed the company-wide turnover average, indicating that attrition is **not evenly distributed** and requires department-specific intervention.

---

### 2. Early-Stage Attrition as a Structural Pattern
Employee exits are heavily concentrated within the **first year of employment**, making early tenure the highest-risk period for retention.

---

### 3. Profile of Employees Who Exit
Employees who leave tend to show:
- Lower satisfaction (avg. 5.8 vs 7.0 for active employees)
- Low to mid performance scores
- A high likelihood of earning **below market compensation** (≈69%)

---

### 4. Internal Salary Inequality as a Turnover Driver
Departments with high turnover often display **high internal salary dispersion**, regardless of average pay level.  
This suggests that **internal equity** plays a stronger role in turnover than salary averages alone.

---

### 5. Primary Reasons for Voluntary Exits
The most common voluntary exit reasons are:
- Career growth
- Compensation
- Culture / fit  

This highlights the importance of long-term development and perceived fairness.

---

## Deliverables
- Cleaned and documented HR dataset (Excel)
- Descriptive analytical report
- Executive-level insights summary
- **Interactive Tableau dashboard** with:
  - Turnover KPIs
  - Performance distribution
  - Satisfaction levels
  - Compensation analysis

## Key Takeaways
- Turnover is driven by **structural and managerial factors**, not isolated events
- The first year of employment is the most critical retention period
- Internal salary inequality significantly impacts employee attrition
- Combining satisfaction, performance, and compensation provides stronger insights than analyzing metrics in isolation
